This appears to be the most touristy and the best hiking approach (Tunel road is easiest by car). The whole path was well maintained (grass was cut for better visibility and overall feel). Park at the ex bus stop near the sign for the cave (špilja) and continue your way through the village. As you reach the top you arrive at the crossroads. Follow the left path that zig-zags above the village. Every turn is clearly marked and in 30 minutes you arrive at the first (called Wide) cave (look on your right as the cave is 50m above the road). As you continue your ascent you will see two via-ferrata climbing paths on your right. 

Warning: This path was not physically researched by us (authors don’t climb via-ferratas) and is a mere representation of the various maps study that authors have conducted, visual queues and web research. If you will document it, please contact us to include you in our research project.

As far as we had concluded, 250m (2-3h) ferrata that leads to the top is classified as B/C with the hanging bridge C section. There is an option of an easier ferrata A/B, connected to the first one. A 50HRK (7EUR) contribution towards ferrata maintenance is suggested for using ferrata. Consider further investigating other sources for current conditions.

Recommended return is via Sveta Nedelja route.
