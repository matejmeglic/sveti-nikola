Probably the easiest route from the altitude standpoint. Follow the road past Selca over the tunnel until you see the gravel road at the top of the hill (pile of rocks). Park there and follow the gravel road (bicycle road 709) east. After a couple of kilometers of mild ascend on the top you reach the point where an unmarked path from Selo joins. Continue right in the direction of Saint Nikola nad 709 sign. After another kilometer you reach the crossroads where the road from the Tunnel joins. Continue left towards Saint Nikola peak. Over the next 30min of mild ascent you will reach the crossroads with the road from Dol. Continue right on the upper plateau. Walk through the agricultural tourism settlement and turn right at the crossroads where the road from Svirƒçe joins. Turn left and approach the final ascent to the top of the island through the gate. Path from Sveta Nedelja joins from the right. Follow the steep road until the tree and climb last 50m on the unmarked path, pass the small building, cross until you reach the chapel on top.
