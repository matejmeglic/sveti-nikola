Park at the ex bus stop near the sign for the cave (špilja) and continue your way through the village. As you reach the top you arrive at the crossroads. At the crossroads head right in the direction of Sveta Nedelja and Jagodna. Path zig-zags gaining altitude and jumps over multiple access gravel roads. All turns are well marked. After 45min of walking, you (not knowingly) step on the very-well-build old road system that traverses just below plateau top and follows east-bound. Follow the markings and at the only crossroad pick left path (right one descends into Jagodna and is marked with stone pillars (Možici)). Additional 20 minutes later you reach the top of the plateau with views over Jagodna and turn west (right path, left goes into the forgotten and likely unmaintained paths towards Ivan Dolac settlement). Follow the path and Saint Nikola peak will be visible in the far. At the only cross-path (with Svirče-east) continue straight and reach the peak from the east.

Please be careful as this route is not as maintained (nor crowded) as Sveta Nedelja west and we saw 3 different snakes. Act accordingly.
