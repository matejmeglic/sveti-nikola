Start at the church and follow the road for 100m until you reach a small chapel with bright blue doors and turn right right behind the chapel. An unmarked road will wind up and at the only crossroads keep straight (don’t turn left). Road becomes an unmaintained path as the views on Stari grad and Selca kod Starog grada become better and better with altitude rising. After an hour of walking, the path will join the well maintained gravel road that is the main bicycle path 709 to the top from Selo. Continue straight (left), follow a sign on the stone (here the path becomes marked and is not steep anymore). After another kilometer you reach the crossroads where the road from the Tunnel joins. Continue left towards Saint Nikola peak. Over the next 30min of mild ascent you will reach the crossroads with the road from Dol. Continue right on the upper plateau. Walk through the agricultural tourism settlement and turn right at the crossroads where the road from Svirče joins. Turn left and approach the final ascent to the top of the island through the gate. Path from Sveta Nedelja joins from the right. Follow the steep road until the tree and climb last 50m on the unmarked path, pass the small building, cross until you reach the chapel on top.
