After the end of the settlement, park your car along the way and follow the road over a small bridge (you can park higher on the road if you want to, there are plenty of side spots one can leave the car). Pick the left road and after a couple of hundred meters, at the crossroads behind the goat farm, pick the right road (follow signs for bicycle route no 708). The interchangeable gravel and paved road will steadily wind between lavender fields until you reach the next crossroads where you again pick the left road that leads uphill. In one kilometer you will reach the left turn that leads into the valley, here you can see the view towards Svriče and Jelsa for the last time. Follow the road through the valley and you will arrive at the plateau crossroads in 15min. Follow the road right in the direction of Saint Nikola peak that becomes visible. Gravel road winds through the fields for the next two kilometers (at the only crossroads continue straight) that lifts up to the upper plateau at the end. When you pass a small chapel on the right, , you continue straight on the main road, but note that is the landmark that if you turn left, approach to the Svirče-east joins the main road from the left (unmaintained path through bushes between two fields). At the end of the ascent, you will come to the agricultural tourism settlement where paths from Tunel, Selo and Dol meet. Turn right and approach the final ascent to the top of the island through the gate. Path from Sveta Nedelja joins from the right. Follow the steep road until the tree and climb last 50m on the unmarked path, pass the small building, cross until you reach the chapel on top.
