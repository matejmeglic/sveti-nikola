This appears to be the most touristy and the best hiking approach (Tunel road is easiest by car). The whole path was well maintained (grass was cut for better visibility and overall feel). Park at the ex bus stop near the sign for the cave (špilja) and continue your way through the village. As you reach the top you arrive at the crossroads. Follow the left path that zig-zags above the village. Every turn is clearly marked and in 30 minutes you arrive at the first (called Wide) cave (look on your right as the cave is 50m above the road). As you continue your ascent you will pass two via-ferrata climbing paths on your right. In a mild right turn you arrive at the crossroads where you continue left (church in the cave on your right 5min). Path traverses above the wine fields and starts zig-zagging again. After 30 minutes of slow walk you reach the top of the plateau, where you turn right at the sign (chapel Sveta Nedjelja 5min on the left across the hill towards the city of Hvar) and follow the road towards Saint Nikola. You can follow the road to agricultural tourism settlement and continue right at the crossroads towards the top that you will reach in 15 minutes as you will pass through the agricultural tourism settlement and turn right at the crossroads where the road from Svirče joins. Turn left and approach the final ascent to the top of the island through the gate. Alternative route that goes over the ridge described bellow joins from the right after 100m. Follow the steep road until the tree and climb last 50m on the unmarked path, pass the small building, cross until you reach the chapel on top.

Alternatively, there is a more scenic route that separates from the gravel road in a sharp right turn at the tree 10min from the sign at the beginning of the plateau (be careful for marked signs on your right, both paths are marked). Heading right on the path (leaving the main road) you cross the plateau (route heads straight with an exception of one mild slope where path from via-ferrata joins). The path offers scenic views towards the east and joins the main road at the beginning of the final ascent.
