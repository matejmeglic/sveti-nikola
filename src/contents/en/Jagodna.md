Start at the main road and ascend into the old upper part of the village (looked abandoned in June 2020) on a concrete road until the end of the concrete. At that moment, continue straight (left) on a gravel road for another 100m. At the next crossroads, the right road returns to the top houses of upper Jagodna, and the left road goes straight ahead into vineyards and fields. In 10m, you will see an additional small path that ascends on top of the vineyards road (stone pillars on the right of the road). Continue straight on the path (do not continue on the zig-zag barely visible path that steeply ascends upwards in the scree as we followed it for the first 100m and it didn’t lead us anywhere and lost itself in the scree) and in 300m the path will lead you to the access road. Continue upwards until you reach the end of the access road OR you can find path upwards on the old transportation system that will zig-zag you the last 100m of altitude (these last 100m were not researched by us, so if you can provide pictures from the access road until the moment where road joins path from Jagodna, please contact us). As you reach the crosspath with the Sveta Nedelja path coming from the west, continue right upwards until you reach the top of the plateau. After 20 min, as you loose sight on Jagodna valley and turn west (right path, left goes into the forgotten and likely unmaintained paths towards Ivan Dolac settlement). Follow the path and Saint Nikola peak will be visible in the far. At the only cross-path (with Svirče-east) continue straight and reach the peak from the east.

Please note that this is an abandoned (and not crowded) path where snake occurrences are likely. Act accordingly.

Alternatively, you can return via Sveta Nedelja route and walk by the road (2.5 km).
