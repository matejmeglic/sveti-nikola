This is the easiest approach to the mountain by car (a combination of gravel and paved road, you can drive up until 50m from the top). For hiking, leave the road 150m before the tunnel (last gravel exit before the tunnel, see signs for agricultural settlement Kolumbič,not the same road that leads to Sveta Nedelja, that one is 200m down in the direction of Hvar (away from the tunnel)) and continue into the valley (bike path 708). Ascend among agricultural land as the views open in all directions the higher you go. After ~45 min of ascend you reach the plateau and the crossroads where roads to Selca (709 bicycle road) joins from the left. Continue right in the direction of Saint Nikola. Over the next 30min of mild ascent you will reach the crossroads with the road from Dol. Continue right on the upper plateau. Walk through the agricultural tourism settlement and turn right at the crossroads where the road from Svirče joins. Turn left and approach the final ascent to the top of the island through the gate. Path from Sveta Nedelja joins from the right. Follow the steep road until the tree and climb last 50m on the unmarked path, pass the small building, cross until you reach the chapel on top. 



Alternatively you can (carefully, the road is still in a bad condition, but relatively easily driveable) drive all the way to the top (5min walking over a path).
